                          YAWL Release 4.0  19/04/2016
                         ==============================

 This is the version 4.0 release of the YAWL Environment.

 There are two major updates in this version:
   - a completely redesigned YAWL Control Panel application
   - a new Worklet Management tool, deployed as an Editor plugin, replacing the
     previous Worklet Rules Editor.

 This version also contains a large number of bugfixes, improvements and
 minor enhancements, incorporating all of the updates to the YAWL environment
 since release 3.0.1. It is highly recommended that all users migrate to this new
 version.
